DKMS-compatible BYD multitouch psmouse kernel module

This repository is just a repackaging of the BYD psmouse patches that are floating around in other repositories specifically https://github.com/purism/linux/ to make it easy to use with DKMS and build against any Debian stretch kernel. It was based off of an old alps psmouse dkms package.

INSTALL

To install, copy the current directory to /usr/src/psmouse-byd-0.2 and run /usr/src/psmouse-byd-0.2/install.sh. This should remove any old psmouse dkms modules and rebuild and install this one. Alternatively you can inspect the install.sh to see what dkms commands were used.

Qubes

If you are using Qubes, the default Fedora kernel has compiled the psmouse driver into the kernel. If you are using 3.1, however, you can pull a modular kernel from unstable with:

sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-unstable kernel-4.1.13-8.1.pvops.qubes.x86_64 kernel-devel-4.1.13-8.1.pvops.qubes.x86_64 kernel-qubes-vm-4.1.13-8.1.pvops.qubes.x86_64

When you reboot you'll need to select this kernel from the Xen submenu. Then you can build the DKMS module as normal.
