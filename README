DKMS-compatible BYD multitouch psmouse kernel module

This repository is just a repackaging of the BYD psmouse patches that are floating around in other repositories specifically https://github.com/purism/linux/ to make it easy to use with DKMS and build against any Debian stretch kernel. It was based off of an old alps psmouse dkms package.

INSTALL

To install, copy the current directory to /usr/src/psmouse-byd-0.1 and run /usr/src/psmouse-byd-0.1/install.sh. This should remove any old psmouse dkms modules and rebuild and install this one. Alternatively you can inspect the install.sh to see what dkms commands were used.
